    "Creating a [Data_Normalization.ipynb]() notebook for your options trading algorithm is an excellent way to ensure data consistency. Data normalization is crucial in trading algorithms as it standardizes the range of independent variables or features of data. In the context of options trading, this might include price data, trading volumes, and other financial indicators.\n",

    "3.  Z-score standardization.\n",
    "4.  Exporting the normalized data.\n",
