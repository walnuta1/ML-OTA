    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this Jupyter Notebook on creating a machine learning-based Options Trading Algorithm! This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide and codebase for traders and machine learning enthusiasts who are interested in applying ML techniques to options trading. From data collection and preprocessing to feature engineering, model building, and risk assessment, this notebook covers the entire pipeline.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is divided into several major sections, each covering an essential aspect of building a machine learning-based trading algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: Fetching historical options data\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing the data\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and selecting the most relevant ones\n",
    "4. **Model Building**: Training machine learning models for predictive trading\n",
    "5. **Backtesting**: Evaluating the trading strategy against historical data\n",
    "6. **Risk Assessment**: Calculating various risk metrics\n",
    "7. **Reporting**: Building a real-time dashboard for performance tracking\n",
    "8. **Utility Functions**: Reusable code snippets and helper functions\n",
    "9. **Unit Testing**: Validating the integrity of the code\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the code, make sure you have installed all the necessary Python libraries. A `requirements.txt` file is provided for easy setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Scientists**: You can go through each section to understand the machine learning models, feature engineering techniques, and evaluation metrics used.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Traders**: If you're more interested in the trading aspect, you might find the Backtesting and Risk Assessment sections particularly useful.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Developers**: If you aim to integrate this notebook into a broader trading system, the Utility Functions and Unit Testing sections will be of interest.\n",
